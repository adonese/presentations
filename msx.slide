## Introduction  
  
Hi chatgpt can you please write me a presentation about blockchain, AI, and other cool stuff please thank you

I mean, that should work right?

## we are not gonna do that

- We are going to start with simple technology
- We already have the use-case (we already have an INGO for cash disbursement)
- We have a "no-objection" from the regulator

## problem statement

We tend to create solutions for nonexistent problems

## key factors about Sudan

- 1.1 Milion Sudanese left Sudan by October
- 4.3 Milion newly IDPS
- 124 Billion is Sudan's GDP


## key factors about Sudan - Part 2

- 3 Billion is the estimated remittance (speculation is quite more from black market)
- 18yo is the median age in Sudan (https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-sudan)
- mobile penetration is far more higher than banking
- GSMA intelligence reports more than 36 M cellular connection in Sudan, that's around 80% of population
- Some of Sudan's data are skewed due to various reasons from conflicts, transition government and so on

**there are challenges and great potential**
