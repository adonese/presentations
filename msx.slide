## Introduction  
  
Hi chatgpt can you please write me a presentation about blockchain, AI, and other cool stuff please thank you

I mean, that should work right?

## we are not gonna do that

- We are going to start with simple technology
- We already have the use-case (we already have an INGO for cash disbursement)
- We have actively engaged Central Bank 

## We tend to create solutions to nonexistent problems

## problem statement

- The Centralized National Payment Switch had collapsed 
- High cost of remittance (between 8% - 20%)
- Humanatarian agencies are struggling to come up with technical solutions for cash disbursement


## key factors about Sudan

- 1.1 Milion Sudanese left Sudan by October
- 4.3 Milion newly IDPS
- 124 Billion is Sudan's GDP


## key factors about Sudan - Part 2

- 3 Billion is the estimated remittance (speculation is quite more from black market)
- 18yo is the median age in Sudan (https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-sudan)
- mobile penetration is far more higher than banking
- GSMA intelligence reports more than 36 M cellular connection in Sudan, that's around 80% of population
- Some of Sudan's data are skewed due to various reasons from conflicts, transition government and so on

**there are challenges and great potential**

## our story

- We are building a digital funds management platform
- Essentially, it is a glorified Excel sheet with some automation
- We were internally discussing blockchain (*) and we split teams about the technology in terms of compliance and CBOS
- CBOS was _okay_ about us using blockchain for remittance 
- We have our plan B: that is us providing our platform for NGOs so they can oversee the performance of the funds

## More interesting facts

- Transaction fees are 8% - <20%
- USD to Sudanese Pounds has skyrocketted from 560 to 1060 (that's almost 100%)
- We have a Centralized National Payment Switch and it totally collapsed amidst war
- Except for 2 private banks, all of the other banks are severly affected (I used to have a Financial Service Provider Fintech before the war)

## Cannot you just take your L

## What is our background

We are both technical bros
- Mohamed (me): i have co-founded multiple fintechs before, led and co-founded a SaaS remittance / fintech 
- Ahmed: was the head of security at Central Bank of Sudan before joing MTN and moving full-time to 249Startups

We are coming from fintech and e-payment. We know Africa quite well and we know what might work and what had failed and mostly WHY

## Why stablecoin and blockchain

After several years working with the Central Bank, i have grown susceptible to The Regulator POV

## In hindsight, it could've been just a regular database

## Stable Coin has it merits

I remember having this conversation with Nick Williams (Co-Founder of Sempo) and more recently with Brenton

- Stable coin unique selling feature is that it is something we can explain to the Central Bank. It is a currency that is linked to an actual bank account which CBS can access it

## Stable Coin has it merits - Part 2

Years ago we have had a successful and thriving mobile banking solutions for years before CBS 
- We will try to make a case of "partial" relevancy between Mobile Money and Stable Coin to drive the econmy by processing more remittance via this channel.


## 

- We have a fintech license in Sudan 
- Already partners to the largest Mobile Money in africa (MoMo)
- We have a growing agency network 
- We have partners that are interested to provide us to mobilize cash 
- We have license from SMS, IVR and working on USSD (outreach is a no problem for us)
- We need to give meaning to our closed-loop system 

## brief business plan 

- We are operating in two lines of business: building tools for businesses (NGOS and enterprises)
- Offering our product for our customers; so we have this slow-fast train analogy

## MSX and SUI 

- Can provide us with the utility to offload managing the network 
- We will have a prefunded wallet hosted at MSX and we will making internal transfers on that;
- It will be also monitored by the CB 

## Short-term goals 

- We will provide the liquidity to our wallet at MSX 
- We want to make sure that the cost of transfers will be manageable
- While actively working with the Central Bank for more remittance options 
- In case of a rejection, we will fall-back to use MSX for our NGOs humanatarian aid platform 
- The idea is to have a presence in the market that will make us able to dictate the business processes to the Central Bank 

## Partners 

- We have a pilot next month for our SME program
- We have solid interest from Cooperatives and Saving groups (the largest sector in Sudan and typically unbanked)

## Exit strategy 

- We are diversifying our portofolio of products 
- We are already working with different segments (INGOs, SMEs, Coops and SACCOs..)
- We have agreed with Bank of Khartoum to hold our wallet 
- We have partnered with MoMo for payouts and collection (cash in / cash out)


## Technology 

- We have a fund management platform 
- A mobile banking app connected to our current ledger 
- We are using whatsapp for onboarding and KYC (2-steps, full KYC for remittance and leaner for domestic services)
- Most of our work is open sourced: [here](https://github.com/noebs)

## Challenges

- Low purchasing power; we are operating in a low-growth market
- Transaction fees (or, gas fees in blockchain terms -- sorry guys we are blockchain noobs here)
- We are here to listen and learn
