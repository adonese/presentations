# NilPay: Keeping the Lights On in Sudan
## A Brutally Honest 3-Month Plan


---

## The Hard Truth

- Sudan's a warzone, folks. Infrastructure's shot.
- Banking system? Laughable.
- 40,000 euros? It's a drop in the ocean.
- But damn it, people need us.

---

## What We're Up Against

- Constant power outages
- Internet? More like "intermittent-net"
- Inflation's eating money faster than we can count it
- Trust in institutions? Gone.

But here's the kicker: People still need to move money, buy essentials, and have a shred of financial dignity.

## The NilPay Promise

We're not here to change the world. We're here to:
1. Keep money moving
2. Help people buy basics
3. Give a damn when no one else does

That's it. No bullshit, no grand promises.

---

## The Plan: Bare Bones, Maximum Impact

1. 50 Agents. That's it.
   - 10 in Kassala, 40 in Gedarif
   - Criteria: Not dead, can count, won't run off with our money

2. Three Services:
   - Money transfers (because people need to eat)
   - Airtime top-ups (because people need to communicate)
   - Basic goods vouchers (partnering with the one shop still open)

3. Tech? What Tech?
   - Rugged phones that can survive a sandstorm
   - Solar chargers (because electricity is a luxury)
   - Paper ledgers (old school, but they don't crash)

---

## Financial Reality Check

- 30,000 euros for agent floats (3,000 each, it's not much but it's honest work)
- 5,000 euros for equipment (phones, solar, ledgers)
- 5,000 euros for when shit inevitably hits the fan

Break-even? Let's be real. We'll be lucky if we're not robbed.

---

## Community Buy-In

- Find the 5 people everyone listens to
- Sit with them, drink tea, explain what we're doing
- Be clear: We're not saviors, just trying to help

If they're in, we have a shot. If not, we pack up and go home.

---

## What Success Looks Like

1. 50 agents still alive and working after 3 months
2. 5,000 transactions (ambitious, but we've got to dream a little)
3. 50 families saying "NilPay helped us eat this week"

That's it. No fancy metrics, no growth projections. Just impact.

---

## Risks (aka Everything)

1. War intensifies
   - Plan: Be ready to evacuate agents in 24 hours

2. Hyperinflation goes hyper-hyper
   - Plan: Daily price adjustments, as painful as they'll be

3. Government decides they don't like us
   - Plan: Keep our local relationships strong, be transparent

## Derisked financing model
- Agents will approach nil 
- Agents will pay for the fees (they will contribute)
- Nilpay will chip in as well 


## 3-Month Timeline

Month 1: Get Set Up
- Find our 50 brave souls
- Train them (1 day, max. Time is money)
- Start with money transfers

Month 2: Expand Carefully
- Add airtime top-ups
- Start conversations for goods vouchers

Month 3: Push Through
- Launch goods vouchers
- Hit our 5,000 transaction goal
- Decide if we're insane enough to continue

---

## The Bottom Line

Look, 40,000 euros won't fix Sudan. But it might help 50 families survive this mess. If we can do that, and not lose everything in the process, I'll call it a win.

We're not here to bullshit. We're here to work.

Let's get started.
